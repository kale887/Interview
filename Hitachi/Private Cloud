Design a private cloud :

Large number of hosts and guests: 90% of servers are vm.

Things to consider : Storage Bandwidth Uptime Monitoring and Scalability

Storage: File system type - Hypervisor - Storage Utility 
think about quantity of storage : Estimate of how much space you need.
Think about speed : fastest storage you can afford.

Bandwidth : SAN : - Put traffic on network , see if current n/w has sufficient bandwidth
Local and Remote : Live migration is the key : Time frame is adequate

Uptime Goal : 99.99% : Number of hosts : All guests should be on node then
Move guest from host 1 to host 2  for maintain.

Power outage : Host at 2 different location : Sufficient hosts at 2 different location
in the event of disaster

Scalability : For future how many vm we need next years or in 5 years.?
Cloud is adaptbily : Ballpark of how many hosts and storage and network demands estimates are important

Hyper-V , SCVM manager,
Vmware : Vsphere ESxi - type1 , vMotion live
DRS - Auto balance loads across hosts
vCloud Director - provision new guests quickly
VCloud Suite - all the above
