Live migration : Move vm to different host, little or low impact on end users

Not all hypervisor support : Its just data in the memory of computer like
word processing document in memory of computer
VM are large amounts of data : It takes amount time size and bandwidth with 2 host

Schedule downtime : Manual or automatic : Constantly monitor with the host and
guest machines out of that host.
Healthy host crash

Much bandwidth

Save the state of vm point in time and we can return to that state.
Revert it back to save state : Save points : Called snapshots or Checkpoints
Are saved state of virtual machine to revert.
Uses : Service pack -> test functionality
Cons : 50 gig snapshot takes spaces as hard-drive
5 snapshots take 6 times more space.
Lazy write : Changes made and make a note of it and
Keep snapshot less than 24 hours. Test and delete
