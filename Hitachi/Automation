How many CPU
How many servers
Virtual Machines : Making a backup and cloning
Emulated Hardware
Same OS

Why VM : Server consolidation : Increasing CPU utilization 60 to 80%
Hardware Independence : Same VM can run on multiple hardware types without any changes in VMachine
Provide better mobility and duplication 
Reduce downtime : Live VM can be moved
Automation of Development and Production

Platform that Vitrual Machine runs on are Hypervisor : Scheduling the CPU, each vm machines gets cpu
Share physical memory
Scuzy Controller, usb controllers ,

2 types of Hypervisor : Baremetal and
Example ESxi : Citrix Zenserver
Less overhead and better performance

HOsted Hypervisor: less performance provide much flexibility and easier management
Vmware fusion : Vmware Workstation
