Just in time resources :

Processor : The number of p change v often - they are fixed.
Advance : can change speed of processor: Present faster as per requirments
More processing power by slowing down when not needed

Memory : Dynamic memory RAM : Minimum amount of ram specified 

Save Energy : Big benefit for company : Helps scale DC :
Enough power to add more servers.
We buy less hardware that means less energy is consumed.
20 power supplies 20 hard drive 20 mother board.

VM route : 1 power piece of hardware and 20 VM on 1 servers
results should be energy consumed is less.

Auto speed up: Monitor of energy consumption

-----Disadvantages of VM----------
Increase complexity : Network , Storage and Troubleshooting
Load on network inscreased.
Lots of packet flowing around our network.
Virtual Network Devices : Switch
Clone or duplicate : 2 VM with duplicated IP and MAC addresses.
Throughput : SAN - Increase the quantity of storage : Large storage required and quality

The bottelneck is storage subsystem.
